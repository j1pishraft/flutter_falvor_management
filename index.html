    <h1>Welcome to Flutter Flavor Management Page</h1>
</main>
<p>In Flutter:<br>
    <br>
    <b>Flavor:</b><br>
    <br>
    A "flavor" refers to a variation or version of an application that is tailored for specific use
    cases, audiences, or environments.
    Flavors are created by defining different configurations, such as API endpoints, app icons,
    branding, or features, for distinct instances of an app within the same codebase.
    Common use cases include developing different versions of an app (e.g., free and premium) or
    creating branded versions for different clients.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Environment:</b><br>
    <br>
    An "environment" in Flutter typically refers to the stage or context in which the application is
    running, such as development, staging, or production.
    Different environments have specific configurations (e.g., debug modes, API endpoints) that are
    essential for testing and deploying applications without modifying the source code.
    Environments help manage settings and behavior variations across development, testing, and
    production stages.<br>
    <br>
    In summary, flavors are used for creating different versions of an app with unique
    configurations, while environments are used to manage various stages of application development
    by adjusting settings and behaviors. Together, flavors and environments enhance the flexibility,
    maintainability, and scalability of Flutter applications.</p><br>
<br>
<p><b>**Note 1**:</b> having only environment doesn't allow you to have same app with different
    icon,
    name and identifier. for that you also need to setup flavor for your project.</p><br>
<p><b>**Note 2**:</b> Usually for environments you can create app_config.json to keep sensitive or
    environment-specific configuration outside your codebase (never pushed to any repo, it is
    saved on local machine or pushed to deployment by using CI/CD pipeline tools during app build
    time) and easily switch between configurations for different environments (development, staging,
    production) by modifying the app_config.json file.</p><br>

<p><b>Steps to create Environments</b><br></p>
<p><b>1. Create enum for your Environment </b><br></p>
<p>In your project directory create a file called app_env.dart to create class "Environment"</p><br>

<br>

<p><b>2. Create main files  </b><br></p>
<p>make a copy of main file and rename them based on how many environment you have<br></p>
<p>In my case I have two environments, dev and prod so I need to have 3 main file, one for dev, one for prod and on main_common.dart<br></p>
