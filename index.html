<p>In Flutter:<br>
    <br>
    Flavor:<br>
    <br>
    A "flavor" refers to a variation or version of an application that is tailored for specific use
    cases, audiences, or environments.
    Flavors are created by defining different configurations, such as API endpoints, app icons,
    branding, or features, for distinct instances of an app within the same codebase.
    Common use cases include developing different versions of an app (e.g., free and premium) or
    creating branded versions for different clients.<br>
    <br>
    Environment:<br>
    <br>
    An "environment" in Flutter typically refers to the stage or context in which the application is
    running, such as development, staging, or production.
    Different environments have specific configurations (e.g., debug modes, API endpoints) that are
    essential for testing and deploying applications without modifying the source code.
    Environments help manage settings and behavior variations across development, testing, and
    production stages.<br>
    <br>
    In summary, flavors are used for creating different versions of an app with unique
    configurations, while environments are used to manage various stages of application development
    by adjusting settings and behaviors. Together, flavors and environments enhance the flexibility,
    maintainability, and scalability of Flutter applications.</p>
